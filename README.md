# DSA210-Term-Project

I am Pelin Durukan, a student at SabancÄ± University, and this is the repository for my DSA 210 Term Project. The goal of this project is to analyze the way I interact with LLMs such as ChatGPT and determine whether I can optimize my use of them.

## **Overview**
Despite being a relatively new form of technology, LLMs became an important part of our everyday lives, today being used for assistance in a variety of topics: academics, well-being, finance and many more. That brings in the question: In the midst of this series of fast-paced technological developments, how does our LLM usage patterns change, and can we improve the way we use them? This project aims to analyze my own personal ChatGPT data, focusing on my chat frequency, prompt length and style, satisfaction and chat topics over time. It will also explore how these patterns are influenced by factors like academic semesters and technological developments, as well as whether specific patterns lead to higher user satisfaction, and how use can be optimized accordingly.
